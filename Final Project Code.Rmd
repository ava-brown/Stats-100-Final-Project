## Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis


```{r}
# import all of the different player stat datasets by position.
db = read_csv("DB.xls.csv")
olb = read_csv("OLB.xls.csv")
qb = read_csv("QB.xls.csv")
wr = read_csv("WR.xls.csv")
de = read_csv("DE.xls.csv")
ilb = read_csv("ILB.xls.csv")
rb = read_csv("RB.xls.csv")
te = read_csv("TE.xls.csv")

# remove row corresponding to average HOF player for that position
db = filter(db, Player != "Average HOF DB")
olb = filter(ilb, Player != "Average HOF OLB")
ilb = filter(olb, Player != "Average HOF ILB")
de = filter(de, Player != "Average HOF DE")

te = filter(te, Player != "Average HOF TE")


# merge the linebacker data sets
lb = bind_rows(olb, ilb)

# remove HOF index from statsreference (this is confounding for our model because we want to make our predictions)
db = subset(db, select = -c(HOFm))
qb = subset(qb, select = -c(HOFm))
lb = subset(lb, select = -c(HOFm))
wr = subset(wr, select = -c(HOFm))
de = subset(de, select = -c(HOFm))
rb = subset(rb, select = -c(HOFm))
te = subset(te, select = -c(HOFm))

# import list of HOF players 
HOF = read_csv("HOF.xls.csv")

```

Add a boolean variable indicating whether or not the player is in the Hall of Fame. This will be our dependent variable of interest for modeling.
```{r}
# list of players in the hof
hofs = as.list(HOF$Player)

# add HOF indicator variable for DBs
db <- db %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# add HOF indicator variable for LBs
lb <- lb %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# add HOF indicator variable for DEs
de <- de %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# add HOF indicator variable for RBs
rb <- rb %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# add HOF indicator variable for QBs
qb <- qb %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# add HOF indicator variable for WRs
wr <- wr %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# add HOF indicator variable for TEs
te <- te %>%
  mutate(HOF = if_else(Player %in% hofs, 1, 0))

# To correctly graph, we need a categorical indicator variable, not a numeric one

# add categorical HOF indicator variable for DBs
db <- db %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

# add HOF categorical indicator variable for LBs
lb <- lb %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

# add HOF categorical indicator variable for DEs
de <- de %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

# add categorical HOF indicator variable for QBs
qb <- qb %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

# add categorical HOF indicator variable for RBs
rb <- rb %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

# add categorical HOF indicator variable for WRs
wr <- wr %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

# add categorical HOF indicator variable for TEs
te <- te %>%
  mutate(HOFcat = if_else(Player %in% hofs, "yes", "no"))

```

Exploratory Data Analysis -- What proportion of our data points correspond to players in the Hall of Fame?
```{r}
# add position identifier column to each data frame
db$Position = "DB"
lb$Position = "LB"
de$Position = "DE"
rb$Position = "RB"
qb$Position = "QB"
wr$Position = "WR"
te$Position = "TE"

# merge all data frames together
all_positions = bind_rows(db, lb, de, rb, qb, wr, te)

# Hall of fame distribution
ggplot(data = all_positions, aes(x = Position, fill = HOFcat)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

Data Cleaning
```{r}
# filter out defensive players who started playing before 2000 (accommodate changes in the game and the types of statistics available)
db = filter(db, From >= 2000)
lb = filter(lb, From >= 2000)
de = filter(de, From >= 2000)

# check for NAs
sum(is.na(db))
sum(is.na(qb))
sum(is.na(lb))
sum(is.na(wr))
sum(is.na(de))
sum(is.na(rb))
sum(is.na(te))

# add a variable for the number of years a players was in the league (or has been in the league if they are active)
db$years_in_league = db$To - db$From
qb$years_in_league = qb$To - qb$From
lb$years_in_league = lb$To - lb$From
wr$years_in_league = wr$To - wr$From
de$years_in_league = de$To - de$From
rb$years_in_league = rb$To - rb$From
te$years_in_league = te$To - te$From

# drop From and To variables -- years in league is more important once we have done necessary filters
# drop HOFcat because we have an equivalent numerical indicator
db = subset(db, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))
de = subset(de, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))
lb = subset(lb, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))
qb = subset(qb, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))
rb = subset(rb, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))
te = subset(te, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))
wr = subset(wr, select = -c(From, To, HOFcat))

# filter df of HoF players to only include those who were inducted before 2024
HOF = filter(HOF, Indct < 2024)
```

When building the clustering model, it is important to include independent paramters. The following correlation matrices reveal the connections between the statistics in the dataframe.
```{r}
# remove Position variable because it is categorical (not numerical) and not needed for future calculations that look at
# each position specifically
# remove name variable and HOFcat because they are not numeric and will cause errors for correlation matrix
db_num = subset(db, select = -c(Player, Position))
qb_num = subset(qb, select = -c(Player, Position))
lb_num = subset(lb, select = -c(Player, Position))
wr_num = subset(wr, select = -c(Player, Position))
de_num = subset(de, select = -c(Player, Position))
rb_num = subset(rb, select = -c(Player, Position))
te_num = subset(te, select = -c(Player, Position))

# set size of the plot
options(repr.plot.width = 10, repr.plot.height = 10)

# correlation heat map for DBs
corDB <- round(cor(db_num), 2)
melted_DB <- melt(corDB)
ggplot(data = melted_DB, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value))+
  geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap for Defensive Backs") 

# correlation heat map for LBs
corLB <- round(cor(lb_num), 2)
melted_LB <- melt(corLB)
ggplot(data = melted_LB, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value))+
  geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap for Line Backers (Inside and Outside)") 

# correlation heat map for DEs
corDE <- round(cor(de_num), 2)
melted_DE <- melt(corDE)
ggplot(data = melted_DE, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value))+
  geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap for Defensive Ends") 

# correlation heat map for RBs
corRB <- round(cor(rb_num), 2)
melted_RB <- melt(corRB)
ggplot(data = melted_RB, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value))+
  geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap for Running Backs") 

# correlation heat map for QBs
corQB <- round(cor(qb_num), 2)
melted_QB <- melt(corQB)
ggplot(data = melted_QB, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value))+
  geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap for Quarter Backs") 

# correlation heat map for WRs
corWR <- round(cor(wr_num), 2)
melted_WR <- melt(corWR)
ggplot(data = melted_WR, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill = value))+
  geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap for Wide Receivers") 

# correlation heat map for TEs

## Profile of the "Typical" Hall of Fame Players for Each Postion

```{r}

# create df with information about only HOF players for each position
db_hof_data = filter(db, HOF == 1)
qb_hof_data = filter(qb, HOF == 1)
lb_hof_data = filter(lb, HOF == 1)
wr_hof_data = filter(wr, HOF == 1)
de_hof_data = filter(de, HOF == 1)
rb_hof_data = filter(rb, HOF == 1)
te_hof_data = filter(te, HOF == 1)

# create a numeric df with HOF player data
db_hof_data = subset(db_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 
qb_hof_data = subset(qb_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 
lb_hof_data = subset(lb_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 
wr_hof_data = subset(wr_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 
de_hof_data = subset(de_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 
rb_hof_data = subset(rb_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 
te_hof_data = subset(te_hof_data, select = -c(Position)) 

```

Now that I have datasets of Hall of Fame players for each position, I will compute averages of their statistics to determine the "typical" Hall of Fame player by position.

```{r}
# add a row to each column for the "average" Hall of Famer
db_hof_data = rbind(db_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF DB", t(colMeans(db_hof_data[-1]))))
de_hof_data = rbind(de_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF DE", t(colMeans(de_hof_data[-1]))))
lb_hof_data = rbind(lb_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF LB", t(colMeans(lb_hof_data[-1]))))
qb_hof_data = rbind(qb_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF QB", t(colMeans(qb_hof_data[-1]))))
rb_hof_data = rbind(rb_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF RB", t(colMeans(rb_hof_data[-1]))))
wr_hof_data = rbind(wr_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF WR", t(colMeans(wr_hof_data[-1]))))
te_hof_data = rbind(te_hof_data, data.frame(Player = "average HOF TE", t(colMeans(te_hof_data[-1]))))

```





## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
